# Digital Garden ðŸŒ±
 The user stories are as follows:

- As a visitor, I want to see a welcoming homepage so that I feel invited to explore the garden site.
- As a visitor, I want to see an overview of my garden (or sample plants) so I can quickly understand what the site is about.
- As a user, I want to see all my plants displayed in a visually appealing grid so I can easily browse them.
- As a user, I want each plant card to show the plant's name and type so I can quickly identify it.
- As a user, I want hover effects on plant cards so the site feels interactive and playful.
- As a user, I want to click on a plant to see more details (e.g., planting date, notes) so I can track its progress.
- As a user, I want images for each plant so I can see how my garden looks visually.
- As a user, I want a form where I can type in plant info (name, type, notes) so I can visualize adding plants to the garden.
- As a user, I want the form styled cleanly with clear labels and inputs so it's easy and fun to use.
- As a user, I want a navigation bar so I can move between sections easily (Home, Plants, About, Contact).
- As a user, I want a responsive layout so the site looks good on both mobile and desktop.
