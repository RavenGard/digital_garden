          The tomato plant typically grows as an annual plant and it is in the
          nightshade family. There are two types of tomatoes: Determinate and
          Indeterminate. Determinate tomatoes grow to a specific height and
          produce one crop of fruit while indeterminate tomatoes grows in a
          vine-like nature and will produce fruit all growing season.
