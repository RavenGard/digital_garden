    <h1>About Us!</h1>
    <h3>A space where you can track what you're planting in real time!</h3>
    <p>
      This is a static website coded in HTML and CSS. The user stories are as
      follows:

    <ul>
      <li>

        to explore the garden site.
      </li>
      <li>
        As a visitor, I want to see an overview of my garden (or sample plants)
        so I can quickly understand what the site is about.
      </li>
      <li>
        As a user, I want to see all my plants displayed in a visually appealing
        grid so I can easily browse them.
      </li>
      <li>
        As a user, I want each plant card to show the plant's name and type so I
        can quickly identify it.
      </li>
      <li>
        As a user, I want hover effects on plant cards so the site feels
        interactive and playful.
      </li>
      <li>
        As a user, I want to click on a plant to see more details (e.g.,
        planting date, notes) so I can track its progress.
      </li>
      <li>
        As a user, I want images for each plant so I can see how my garden looks
        visually.
      </li>
      <li>
        As a user, I want a form where I can type in plant info (name, type,
        notes) so I can visualize adding plants to the garden.
      </li>
      <li>
        As a user, I want the form styled cleanly with clear labels and inputs
        so it's easy and fun to use.
      </li>
      <li>
        As a user, I want a navigation bar so I can move between sections easily
        (Home, Plants, About, Contact).
      </li>
      <li>
        As a user, I want a responsive layout so the site looks good on both
        mobile and desktop.
      </li>
    </ul>
